# ScheduleIMenu

A simple cheat tool for modifying game features like balance, cash, and others in Schedule I.

## Features (For now)

- **Balance Modification**: Allows the user to set their online balance to any value.
- **Cash Modification**: Allows the user to set their in-game cash to any value.

**Obs**: When using Balance/Cash modification, you need to make a transaction for them to update in your item bar, if you check an ATM they will be at the value you set.

## How to use:
1. Download the `Release.zip` folder from the [releases](https://github.com/artorias305/ScheduleIMenu/releases/tag/V1.0.0)
2. Unzip the folder
3. Run the tool `ScheduleIMenu.exe` with your game open
4. Enter commands like:
	- `balance 1000` to set your balance to `1000`.
	- `cash 5000` to set your cash to `5000`.
